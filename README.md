ZGC Timer
================

 Background Proof, Termination Proof Timer, Reboot Proof Timer.


[ZGC Timer][] is powered by `NSTimer` to work as a full CountDown Timer.

The best thing about [ZGC Timer][] is that it work acrross **Background App**, **Background Termination** and even **Device Rebbot**.


###Usage

If you want it to work across **Background App**, **Background Termination** and even **Device Rebbot**.
You need to call these two method:

```
// To get a timer.
+ (ZGCountDownTimer *)countDownTimerWithIdentifier:(NSString *)identifier;

// Start using the timer.
- (void)setupCountDownForTheFirstTime:(void (^)(ZGCountDownTimer *timer))firstBlock restoreFromBackUp:(void (^)(ZGCountDownTimer *timer))restoreFromBackup;
```

else it would be just a regular stopWatch the only work across **Background App**.


Control the CountDown timer is as easy as it say:

```
- (BOOL)startCountDown;
- (BOOL)pauseCountDown;
- (void)resetCountDown;
```

Also, there is two help method to help you get the awesome `NSString` with or without customize `NSNumberFormatter`.

```
+ (NSString *)getDateStringForTimeInterval:(NSTimeInterval )timeInterval;
+ (NSString *)getDateStringForTimeInterval:(NSTimeInterval )timeInterval withDateFormatter:(NSNumberFormatter *)dateFormatter;
```

For more detail please see the damo app, or read the docs in the .h file.    
Enjoy.
